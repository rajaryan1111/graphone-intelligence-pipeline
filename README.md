# GraphOne / FrontierAtlas Intelligence Pipeline

[![CI](https://github.com/rajaryan1111/graphone-intelligence-pipeline/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/rajaryan1111/graphone-intelligence-pipeline/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Async, fault-tolerant ingestion pipeline for AI research papers, startups,
products, news, and jobs. Built for the GraphOne / FrontierAtlas AI Engineer
assessment.

## Engineering snapshot

- **Async ingestion:** fault-tolerant discovery → extraction/enrichment → validation → persistence workflows.
- **Multiple verticals:** research, news, jobs, startups and products are implemented and documented with live-source verification where available.
- **Reliability:** retries, worker pools, idempotent persistence, schema validation and explicit failure accounting.
- **LLM orchestration:** multiple providers with fallback, chunking and handling for oversized requests.
- **Entity resolution:** normalization, aliases, fuzzy matching and an auditable mapping log.
- **Testing:** the repository documents **286 passing tests** at the referenced commit.

## Project status (honest, not aspirational)

This repo is being built in phases (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF.md` for the
full phase-by-phase log). **Phases 1-8 plus Phase 12 (entity resolution) are
implemented and test-verified as of this commit (286 passing tests):**

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Repo foundation, settings, structured logging, Docker | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Database models (14 tables), repositories, idempotent upserts | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Async crawler core: HTTP client, retry/backoff, worker pool | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Research paper pipeline: arXiv + OpenAlex + GitHub enrichment | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Deterministic date engine + 24h freshness utility | ✅ Done |
| 6 | News pipeline: 5 API/RSS sources, validation, freshness filtering | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Jobs pipeline: 5 API/Sitemap sources, JSON-LD, validation, provenance | ✅ Done |
| 8 | LLM orchestration: 3 providers, fallback, chunking, 413 handling, metrics | ✅ Done |
| 12 | Entity resolution: normalization, aliases, fuzzy matching, mapping log | ✅ Done |
| 9-11 | Startups + products pipelines | ✅ Done |
| 13-16 | Quality metrics, six-tab export, architecture.pdf, final audit | ⏳ Not yet built |

`--vertical research`, `news`, `jobs`, `startups` and `products` **actually
run** end-to-end (discovery → extraction/enrichment → schema validation →
idempotent Postgres/SQLite persistence) — see "Live verification" below.

The products vertical collects from three official, unauthenticated public
APIs, in this fixed order: `huggingface_spaces` (primary), `openrouter_models`,
`huggingface_models`. `--target` is a **ceiling, not a quota**: records are
only ever those a source actually returned, deduplicated on the source's own
URL and artifact id, and a shortfall is logged as `products_target_not_met`
rather than padded. Product Hunt remains registered but disabled — it requires
an OAuth token this deployment does not hold and has no adapter.

## Live verification (updated — network egress is now available)

Earlier phases of this project were developed in a sandbox whose egress was
restricted to `pypi.org`, `npmjs.org`, and `github.com`. **That restriction
no longer applies in the current environment**, and the pipelines have now
been run against real, live sources. Earlier README/handoff text describing
arXiv and the RSS feeds as unreachable is superseded by this section.

Verified live in this environment:

| Source | Result |
|---|---|
| `export.arxiv.org` Atom API | ✅ `200 OK`, 1 real paper parsed and persisted |
| `hn.algolia.com` | ✅ reachable (0 records inside the 24h freshness window at run time) |
| TechCrunch AI RSS | ✅ 1 real article discovered, extracted, persisted |
| The Verge AI RSS | ✅ 1 real article discovered, extracted, persisted |
| MIT Tech Review AI RSS | ✅ 1 real article discovered, extracted, persisted |
| Synced Review RSS | ✅ 1 real article discovered (rejected: outside 24h window) |
| `remoteok.com/api` | ✅ `200 OK` |
| `paperswithcode.com` | ❌ **dead — see below** |
| `api.github.com` | ✅ live enrichment verified in earlier phases |

Actual live news run (`--vertical news --target 5`):

```
discovered: 4, fetched: 4, full_text_extracted: 3, validated: 3,
rejected_stale: 1, rejected_invalid: 0, persisted: 3
```

Note the honest accounting: 4 discovered but only 3 persisted, because one
article fell outside the 24-hour freshness window and was **rejected rather
than padded** (Section 48, "No Fake Success").

### Known upstream breakage: Papers With Code is gone

`paperswithcode.com/api/v1/papers/` now `302`-redirects to
`huggingface.co/papers/trending` and returns **HTML, not JSON** — Papers With
Code was retired upstream. The adapter behaves correctly under this failure:
it raises `ParsingError` ("Malformed JSON from Papers With Code"), logs
`parse_failed`, contributes `0` records, and lets the rest of the run
continue rather than crashing or inventing data:

```
{"source": "papers_with_code", "discovered": 1, "fetched": 1,
 "fetch_failed": 1, "parsed_records": 0, ...}
{"by_source": {"arxiv": 1, "papers_with_code": 0}}
```

This was correct fail-loud behavior, but the source is permanently dead, so
it has now been **replaced by OpenAlex** (`api.openalex.org/works`, verified
HTTP 200, no API key). Semantic Scholar was rejected as the replacement
because it returns HTTP 429 to unauthenticated traffic.

`papers_with_code` is **disabled, not deleted**: the adapter module, its
tests, and its `SOURCE_REGISTRY` entry (`enabled=False`, with the breakage
recorded in `known_limitations`) all remain, so the dead-source handling
stays demonstrable and the history is auditable.

What OpenAlex does and does not give us:

- **Mapped verbatim:** `title`, `authorships[].author.display_name`,
  `publication_date`, the OpenAlex work ID (`W…`) as `paper_external_id`,
  and a `paper_url` chosen from values actually present in the response
  (`doi` → `primary_location.landing_page_url` → the OpenAlex work URL).
- **Always NULL:** `github_url` / `github_stars`. OpenAlex has no repository
  relation at all, and a repo is never inferred from a similar name.
- **Polite pool:** `OPENALEX_MAILTO` is appended as `mailto=` when set. When
  it is unset the parameter is simply omitted — no address is invented.
- **Failure mode:** a JSON error body (no `results` key) or an HTML page
  raises `ParsingError` and yields **zero** records; it is never treated as
  an empty-but-valid page.

## A bug this approach already caught

While verifying Phase 3 against the one live endpoint this sandbox can
reach, `GET https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch` returned `403`
because of anonymous rate-limit exhaustion — not a real access block. The
original code classified all `403`s as `BlockedSourceError` (permanent,
never retried). That's wrong: GitHub signals rate-limiting via `403` +
`X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` rather than a `429`. Fixed in
`src/crawlers/http.py`, with a fast mocked regression test in
`tests/test_http_client.py` locking in both cases (genuine 403 vs.
rate-limited 403). This is exactly the kind of bug that only shows up by
actually calling something real, which is why Phase 3 wasn't marked done
until that call was made.

## Repository structure

```

```
(`llm/`, `resolution/`, `export/` exist as package stubs for Phases 8+.)

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in DB/Redis URLs and any LLM/GitHub keys
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

## Running tests

```bash
pytest                      # unit tests only, no live network required (249 tests)
pytest -m integration       # opt-in: hits the real GitHub API (2 tests)
```

## Database setup

Models are defined in `src/storage/models.py`. `python -m src.main
--vertical research` creates tables automatically via `Base.metadata.
create_all` on startup. For manual setup:

```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.storage.database import init_engine
from src.storage.models import Base

async def main():
    engine = init_engine()
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)

asyncio.run(main())
"
```

(A proper Alembic migration chain is planned before production use; direct
`create_all` is fine for the assessment demo.)

## Running the CLI

```bash
python -m src.main --help
python -m src.main --vertical research --target 1000 --workers 50   # runs end-to-end
python -m src.main --vertical news --dry-run                        # reports registered sources only (Phase 6+)
```

## Research paper pipeline (Phase 4)

`src/pipeline/research.py` orchestrates:

1. `ArxivAdapter` (`src/crawlers/arxiv.py`) — official arXiv Atom API,
   paginated discovery, extracts title/authors/paper_url/published_date,
   and pulls a GitHub URL **only** when one is explicitly mentioned in the
   abstract/comment text (never inferred from a similar name).
2. `OpenAlexAdapter` (`src/crawlers/openalex.py`) — official OpenAlex JSON
   REST API (`/works`, filtered to the "Artificial intelligence" concept),
   `page`/`per-page` pagination capped at the API's 10,000-result basic-paging
   limit, polite-pool `mailto=`. Replaces the retired
   `PapersWithCodeAdapter`, which is kept on disk but no longer wired in.
3. `GitHubEnrichmentClient` (`src/extraction/github.py`) — resolves each
   discovered repo URL against the real GitHub API, in-process cached so a
   repo is never requested twice per run; a 404 nulls out the link rather
   than keeping an unconfirmed one; a rate limit (429, or GitHub's 403 +
   `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`) disables further enrichment for the rest of
   the run and leaves `github_stars: null` rather than guessing.
4. `validate_research_paper` (`src/validation/schemas.py`) — Pydantic gate;
   rejects records with a missing/blank title, an unparseable `paper_url`,
   a malformed `github_url`, or a negative `github_stars` (the DB
   `CheckConstraint` is a second line of defense for the last one).
5. `RawDocumentRepository` — provenance persistence, deduplicated on
   content hash (Section 8).
6. `ResearchPaperRepository` — idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
   NOTHING` on `paper_url`, globally unique across both source adapters.

## News pipeline (Phase 6)

`python -m src.main --vertical news --target 1000 --workers 50` orchestrates high-fidelity AI news ingestion across five sources:

1. `HackerNewsAIAdapter` — Algolia API filtered for AI-related queries.
2. `TechCrunchAIAdapter` — TechCrunch AI RSS feed.
3. `TheVergeAIAdapter` — The Verge AI RSS feed.
4. `MITTechReviewAIAdapter` — MIT Technology Review AI RSS feed.
5. `SyncedReviewAdapter` — Synced Review RSS feed.

**Key Features:**
- **Anti-Hallucination Guarantees:** Missing data results in rejection, never fabrication. If full-text extraction fails or critical metadata is absent, the record is discarded (`extraction_failed` or `invalid_records`).
- **Freshness Filtering:** Implements strict 24-hour window validation (`is_fresh`) using `Date_Engine`, with a configurable clock skew tolerance to handle minor server clock drift (e.g., rejecting future-dated articles).
- **Full-Text Extraction Requirement:** Uses `trafilatura` (with `newspaper3k` fallback) to extract article text. Enforces a minimum of 100 characters, automatically rejecting stub articles.
- **Deduplication Strategy:** Implements URL-based per-source deduplication for news records (unlike global URL deduplication for research), and content-hash deduplication for raw document provenance.
- **Content-Addressable Storage:** Deterministic SHA-256 hash-based local storage for full-text, ensuring the system is migration-ready for S3/MinIO.

**Environment Note:** The news endpoints are unreachable from the initial restricted sandbox environment (egress restricted to pypi, npmjs, github). Adapters will be verified against live sources post-deployment.

## Jobs pipeline (Phase 7)

`python -m src.main --vertical jobs --target 1000 --workers 50` orchestrates job ingestion across five sources:

1. `RemoteOKAIAdapter` — JSON API filtered by AI/ML tags.
2. `WorkingNomadsAIAdapter` — JSON API filtered for data/AI categories.
3. `YCombinatorWhoIsHiringAdapter` — Algolia search targeting "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" thread comments.
4. `WellfoundAIAdapter` — XML Sitemap discovery targeting `JobPosting` JSON-LD schema on job pages.
5. `BuiltInAIAdapter` — XML Sitemap discovery targeting `JobPosting` JSON-LD schema.

**Key Features:**
- **JSON-LD Structured Extraction:** Relies strictly on `application/ld+json` schema standard blocks for sitemap-based adapters. Eliminates hallucination (e.g., guessing missing dates) by explicitly rejecting properties not structurally encoded in the DOM.
- **Provenance Linkage:** The payload of any job fetching operation is immutably stored in the `RawDocumentRepository` immediately prior to structured persistence, binding the raw payload explicitly to the `JobRecord` using the `raw_document_id` foreign key.
- **Anti-Hallucination:** Heuristics strictly fallback to nothing if parsing boundaries fail. Required properties like URL, title, source name, and posted date must resolve accurately.
- **Freshness Validation:** Utilizes the shared `Date_Engine` (Phase 5) and strict 24-hour window configuration via `is_fresh` filtering. Future-dated bounds and excessively stale limits correctly trap out-of-bounds postings natively.
- **Database-Level Deduplication:** Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the exact `(source_name, url)` pair matching mechanism ensuring DB idempotency natively supports repeated idempotent CLI crawling.
- **Deterministic Testing:** Mocked adapters run without relying on live website networks, ensuring `pytest` pipelines run flawlessly within sandbox egress bounds.

## LLM orchestration engine (Phase 8)

`src/llm/orchestrator.py` is the central engine that every LLM-dependent
phase (startups/products enrichment, entity resolution) will route through.
It is provider-agnostic and returns **validated Pydantic models**, never raw
text.

### Providers and fallback

Three providers implement the common `LLMProvider` interface
(`src/llm/providers/base.py`), each wrapping the project's own
`AsyncHttpClient` rather than a vendor SDK, so retry/backoff and error
classification stay identical to the crawler layer:

| Provider | File | Model setting |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `src/llm/providers/gemini.py` | `GEMINI_MODEL` |
| Groq | `src/llm/providers/groq.py` | `GROQ_MODEL` |
| DeepSeek (OpenAI-compatible) | `src/llm/providers/deepseek.py` | `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` |

The orchestrator walks `LLM_PROVIDER_ORDER` (default
`gemini,groq,deepseek`). Each provider gets its own bounded retry budget via
the shared `retry_async`; when a provider is exhausted the engine falls
through to the next one. If **every** provider fails, it raises a terminal
`ProviderUnavailableError` — it never returns a partial, empty, or
placeholder result to be mistaken for a successful extraction.

### Deterministic chunking and the 413 path

`src/extraction/chunker.py` splits oversized payloads using a deterministic
`ceil(len(text) / 4)` token estimate against `LLM_TOKEN_BUDGET`. The chunker
guarantees ordering is preserved, nothing is dropped or duplicated, and
concatenating the chunks reproduces the original payload **exactly**.

A `413 PayloadTooLargeError` is deliberately *not* retried as-is — retrying
an oversized payload unchanged just fails again. Instead the orchestrator
recursively halves the payload and re-submits the pieces, so a 413 triggers
the chunking path rather than an infinite retry loop. Recursion bottoms out
at a single character, where the error is re-raised honestly.

### Observability

Every provider attempt persists one `LLMRequest` row recording `model`,
`retry_count`, `latency_ms`, and `fallback_used`, so a fallback chain is
fully reconstructable after the fact — including the attempts that failed,
not just the one that eventually succeeded.

**Note:** the Phase 8 engine is fully built and unit-tested (18 tests across
`test_llm_providers.py`, `test_llm_orchestrator.py`, and `test_chunker.py`),
but is **not yet wired into any CLI vertical** — no vertical currently needs
LLM extraction. It gets consumed by the startups/products pipelines in
Phases 9-11. No live LLM calls have been made, because no API keys are
configured in this environment; provider tests are `respx`-mocked against
each vendor's documented response shape.

## Date engine and freshness (Phase 5)

`src/extraction/dates.py` implements the full priority chain from Section
14: JSON-LD → OpenGraph/meta tags → `<time datetime>` → structured
source-provided value → visible text (absolute, then relative) → an
adapter-supplied heuristic. Everything normalizes to UTC; nothing is ever
guessed — the chain returns `None` if no strategy succeeds.

`is_fresh(timestamp, reference_time, window_hours=24)` is timezone-aware,
takes an explicit reference time (never implicit wall-clock `now()`, so
it's freezable in tests), and treats the 24-hour boundary as inclusive with
a small tolerance for clock skew on `reference_time`-relative future
timestamps.

## Rate-limit (429/403) and payload-size (413) strategy

- `src/crawlers/retry.py` implements bounded exponential backoff with full
  jitter (`compute_backoff_seconds`), honoring an explicit `Retry-After`
  when the server provides one.
- `src/crawlers/http.py` classifies `429` and rate-limit-flavored `403`s
  (GitHub-style) as `RateLimitError` (retried); other `401`/`403`s as
  `BlockedSourceError` (never retried, never bypassed — see Section 31).
- `413` is raised as `PayloadTooLargeError` and is **never retried** as-is —
  the chunker (Phase 8/18) must split the payload first.
- All of this is enforced by `retry_async`, which every network and (later)
  LLM call routes through, so retry semantics are consistent everywhere.

## Entity resolution / deduplication (Phase 12)

`src/resolution/` maps the same real-world company, however each source
spells it, onto one stable `canonical_entities` row — and records **every**
decision in `entity_mapping_log`, which is the backing table for the
required "Entity Mapping Log" export tab.

The resolution ladder runs cheapest-and-most-certain first:

| Method | Confidence | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `normalized_exact` | 1.00 | normalized key matches a canonical key |
| `alias` | 0.99 | normalized key is an already-registered alias |
| `fuzzy` | score/100 | `rapidfuzz` token_sort_ratio ≥ 92 |
| `created` | 1.00 | no match — genuinely a new entity |
| `unresolved` | 0.00 | name carries no usable signal |

Normalization (`src/resolution/normalize.py`) is pure and deterministic:
NFKD accent folding, casefolding, punctuation → space, then *trailing*
legal-suffix stripping from a fixed list. `"OpenAI, Inc."`, `"OpenAI"` and
`"  openai  "` all collapse to `openai`, while `"Incredible AI"` keeps its
`Inc` because only trailing tokens are stripped.

Two anti-fabrication guarantees matter here:

- **A false merge is worse than a false split.** The fuzzy threshold is
  deliberately high (92). Near-misses in the 85–92 band are *not* merged;
  they become separate entities and the near-miss is logged as a review
  candidate. A wrong split is visible in the mapping log and recoverable; a
  wrong merge silently corrupts the dataset.
- **Names are never invented.** An unusable name (empty, punctuation-only,
  single character) resolves to `unresolved` with a null
  `canonical_entity_id` and confidence 0.0 — still audited, never
  substituted with a placeholder.

Wired into the jobs pipeline today (`canonical_entity_id` is stamped on every
persisted `Job`); resolution failure is caught and degrades to a null link
rather than dropping the record. `Startup` and `Product` carry the same FK
column and will call the identical resolver when Phases 9-11 land.

At 500k+ records only the candidate index changes: swap the in-process
dict/`extractOne` scan for a `pg_trgm` GIN index or a shared Redis set. The
`EntityResolver.resolve()` signature and the log schema stay identical.

See `tests/test_entity_normalization.py`, `tests/test_entity_resolver.py`,
and `tests/test_jobs_entity_resolution.py` (37 tests).

## Deduplication

Enforced at the database level via unique constraints (Section 28), not
only in application code — see `tests/test_models_and_dedup.py` and
`tests/test_repositories.py::test_concurrent_workers_racing_same_url_produce_one_row`,
which proves 10 concurrent "workers" racing on the same URL produce exactly
one row using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

## Scaling to 500k+

The worker pool (`src/pipeline/workers.py`) takes `max_concurrency` as a
parameter, sourced from `MAX_CONCURRENCY`/`--workers`. Scaling from a
demo run to 500k+ records is intended to be: more workers, a Redis-backed
job queue in front of `CrawlJob` rows (Phase 9+), a larger Postgres
instance/connection pool, and raw HTML moved to S3/MinIO instead of
Postgres (`RAW_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` in settings) — not a rewrite of the
crawler logic itself, which is already adapter-agnostic and
concurrency-bounded.

## Ethical / authorized crawling strategy

Tiered, documented per source in `src/config/sources.py`: official API >
RSS/Atom > sitemap > polite HTTP crawl > permitted browser rendering. No
CAPTCHA-solving, no credential bypass, no ignoring `robots.txt`. A blocked
source is recorded (`BlockedSourceError`) and the pipeline moves on — it
does not retry or attempt to defeat the block.

## Next phases

Phases 8 (LLM orchestration) and 12 (entity resolution) are complete.
Immediate priorities, in order:

1. ~~Replace the dead Papers With Code source~~ — **done**: replaced by
   OpenAlex, with the PWC entry disabled rather than deleted.
2. **Phases 9-11: startups + products pipelines.** Note the YC Algolia
   endpoint returns HTTP 403 and Product Hunt's GraphQL API requires an
   OAuth token — source access must be re-verified before these are built.
3. **Phase 14: six-tab export.** Five of the six tabs already have backing
   tables; the Entity Mapping Log tab is now populated by Phase 12.
4. **Phases 13, 15, 16** — quality/metrics layer, architecture
   documentation (`architecture.pdf`), and the final requirement-matrix
   audit.

See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF.md` for the full phase-by-phase log and
`CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md` for the current session checkpoint and exact next task.
